    <h3>Welcome to the realm of my creativity, where you'll discover the essence of who I amâ€”an artist, a problem-solver, and an advocate for pushing the boundaries of design. When I'm not coding, you'll find me immersed in the colorful worlds of anime, shows, and kdramas, where storytelling and visuals inspire my creative mind. Alongside my love for technology, I indulge in the art of drawing, where imagination meets paper. And to keep a healthy balance, I enjoy the adrenaline rush of badminton, staying active and focused. Join me on this journey of art, code, and entertainment as we explore the possibilities together!</h3>
